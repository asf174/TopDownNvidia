El objetivo es el de obtener los STALLS provocados por los espacios de memoria...
Espacios de memoria:

    - Memoria Global: gld_transactions, gst_transactions
    - Memoria Constante: stall_constant_memory_dependency. DICE TEXTUALMENTE: "Percentage of stalls occurring because of immediate CONSTANT cache miss."
    - Memoria Shared: shared_store_transactions, shared_load_transactions
    - Memoria Local: local_load_transactions, local_store_transactions
    - Memoria caché Unificada L1/ Cache de Texturas:
    - Memoria caché L2: l2_read_transactions, l2_write_transactions
    - DRAM: (eventos): l2_subp0_write_sector_misses, l2_subp1_write_sector_misses, l2_subp0_read_sector_misses, l2_subp1_read_sector_misses

    - L2 (con eventos): # Provienen de L1, Texture cache, system memory.
        - LOAD: l2_subp0_total_read_sector_queries, l2_subp1_total_read_sector_queries
        - WRITE: l2_subp0_total_write_sector_queries, l2_subp1_total_write_sector_queries


https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60535867/what-is-a-transaction-and-a-request-in-the-gld-transactions-per-request-metric

In an attempt to explain it to myself, this what I have come up with:

    Request: a load on the warp-level, i.e. one warp-level instruction merged from 32 threads. In this scenario a 32 threads * 8 bytes = 256 byte load. -- Is this correct?
    Transaction: a 32 byte load instruction. In this scenario one transaction defined in this way is able to load 32 bytes / 8 bytes = 4 doubles. -- Is this correct? If so, is this the largest load instruction Cuda implements?
