--------------------------------- 
El objetivo es el de obtener los STALLS provocados por los espacios de memoria...
Espacios de memoria:

    - Memoria Global: gld_transactions, gst_transactions
    - Memoria Constante: stall_constant_memory_dependency. DICE TEXTUALMENTE: "Percentage of stalls occurring because of immediate CONSTANT cache miss."
    - Memoria Shared: shared_store_transactions, shared_load_transactions
    - Memoria Local: local_load_transactions, local_store_transactions
    - Memoria caché Unificada L1/ Cache de Texturas:
    - Memoria caché L2: l2_read_transactions, l2_write_transactions
