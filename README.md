<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The TopDown tool analyzes the bottlenecks of applications running on NVIDIA GPUs. The tool supports ANY TYPE of application running on your GPU.

The objective of the application is to try to detect the parts of the architecture that have suffered the most during the execution of the application. In other words, it is intended to check the parts of the architecture that have been stalled during the execution of a given application. The objective is to verify that parts of your GPU architecture have caused a loss of IPC (Instructions per Cycle) compared to the ideal IPC of your GPU (that is, the maximum IPC that your GPU can achieve). For this, an exhaustive analysis of the different parts of the architecture will be carried out, to try to clarify the losses.

To carry out the above tasks, the application has several levels of execution. As we go deeper and lower levels, the level of detail ofthe results will increase, providing specific parts of the architecture. The highest level offers less detail, grouping more parts of the architecture into one.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Throughout this section we will discuss how the application should be used correctly, as well as the necessary utilities for it to work correctly. 

### Prerequisites

This application is developed in Python, so it will be necessary to have a python compiler to be able to execute the program. It is advisable to have a sufficiently updated version, since the code has elements that are not typical of old versions (less than python3). This is why it is essential to have at least one version of python3 installed.

The following summarizes the commands necessary to install a stable version of python3 for this application: 

  ```bash
  # update repositories
  sudo apt update

  sudo apt install software-properties-common

  # add repository
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa

  # install
  sudo apt install python3.9

  # this command must return the version (3.9) without errors	
  python3.9 --version
  ```

### Installation

1. Download the application
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/asf174/TopDownNvidia.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```JS
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
